jenkins
----------

various stages 

1- code review 
2- unit test
3- code coverage
4-package

all the steps performed by maven

we can direcly package the code without help of jenkins by using maven

root@ip-172-31-22-222:~/samplejavaapp#  /opt/apache-maven-3.8.3/bin/mvn package


CI PIPELINE:- if we execute various stages of build code process in a sequentail manner thats called " continous integration pipeline"

home directory paths of java , maven , jenkins:-


java:-  /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64


maven:- /opt/apache-maven-3.8.3

jenkins:- /var/lib/jenkins

package

code-review:- -P metrics pmd:pmd  ( programme mistake detector)--- under jenkins home -- /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/code-review/target -pmd.xml
so jenkins cant understand that file we can use plugin to see that (	
Warnings Next Generation) -plugin name

unit test: goals: - test

xml :- target/surefire-reports/*.xml (post build) 

-- this unit-test job will execute various test cases ( actualy these test cases will given by developers in source code according to that it will give the results)
